## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Database Schema** ✅
```
users, quest_templates, quests, submissions, votes, 
friendships, locations, streaks, notifications, 
leaderboard_snapshots, moderation_flags
```

### **API Structure** ✅
```
/api/health, /api/auth/*, /api/quests/*, 
/api/templates, /api/admin/*
```

### **External Integrations** ✅
- **Weather:** Open-Meteo (free, no API key)
- **Maps:** Overpass API (OpenStreetMap)
- **Auth:** KeyN OAuth (byNolo)
- **Storage:** MinIO (S3-compatible)

---

## 🧪 **Testing Status**

### **Working Endpoints** ✅
- `GET /api/health` - Service health check
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Authentication status
- `GET /api/quests/today` - Quest generation (with/without auth)
- `GET /api/templates` - Template listing
- `POST /api/admin/seed-templates` - Template initialization

### **Verified Features** ✅
- Weather API integration (real-time data)
- Place lookup (OpenStreetMap integration)
- Quest variation by user (deterministic seeding)
- Database migrations (Alembic)
- Frontend quest display (weather, difficulty, context)
- Docker container orchestration

## 🔧 **Development Commands**

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Rebuild specific service
docker compose build api && docker compose up -d api

# Check logs
docker compose logs api --tail=20

# Database migration
docker compose exec api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head

# Test endpoints
curl -H "X-Debug-User: testuser" http://localhost:8080/api/quests/today
```

## 📊 **Metrics & Progress**

- **Database Tables:** 11/11 implemented ✅
- **Core APIs:** 6/6 working ✅
- **Quest Templates:** 6 diverse templates ✅
- **External APIs:** 2/2 integrated (Weather + Maps) ✅
- **Authentication:** KeyN OAuth fully working ✅
- **Frontend Components:** Quest display complete ✅

**Overall Progress:** ~30% complete (Phases 0-1 of 5)

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria for Phase 2**

1. **Media Upload Working** - Users can upload photos/videos from web and mobile
2. **Submission Creation** - Users can complete quests with media + captions
3. **Global Feed** - All submissions visible in chronological feed
4. **Media Processing** - Automatic thumbnails and optimization
5. **MinIO Integration** - Reliable file storage and serving

**Target Completion:** Phase 2 estimated at 1-2 weeks

## 📝 **Notes**

- **KeyN Integration:** Fully functional OAuth flow with JWT validation
- **Quest Variety:** Deterministic but varied based on user hash and date
- **Weather Responsiveness:** Quests adapt to current conditions automatically
- **Scalability:** Redis caching for weather/places, PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Development:** Debug authentication (X-Debug-User header) for easy testing

**Current Status:** Infrastructure solid, quest generation polished, ready for media pipeline.
